I'm a **computational neuroscience** PhD student working at the <a href="http://ccbrain.org" target="_blank">Cognitive and Computational Brain</a> lab based in the <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cardiff-university-brain-research-imaging-centre" target="_blank">Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre</a>.
Moreover, I help <a href="http://appsilondatascience.com/" target="_blank">Appsilon Data Science</a> team to develop their open source R packages. I'm interested in **neuroscience** and **machine-learning**, particularly **decision making** (of humans and machines). I'm also advocate of the **open science** movement and enjoy contributing to **open source** tools.

## Talks

Some of the talks I gave at **meet-ups**: [CaRdiff](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/ddwgcnywpbdb/), [PyData Cardiff](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Cardiff-Meetup/events/253161612/), **scientific conferences**: *Aspects of Neuroscience*, or **workshops**: [Big Data and HPC](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/international/summer-schools/big-data-and-high-performance-computing).

In May 2018 I co-organized the workshop [Best programming practices for open science](https://sciprogramming.wordpress.com/) for **GW4** promoting good programming standards.
